## 📝 Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying bird sounds from audio clips, leveraging the extensive dataset provided by the BirdCLEF 2025 competition. The classification system aids in biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts using machine learning.

We employ audio preprocessing techniques such as **Mel spectrogram conversion**, and deep learning architectures like **CNNs** and **transfer learning** using pretrained models for efficient and accurate predictions.
